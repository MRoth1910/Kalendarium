# Kalendarium

A repository for some materials related to the Catholic liturgy, namely a table of moveable feasts and the perpetual Roman calendar.

The tool for calculating the Dominical letter and the number of weeks after Pentecost is found here. https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/easter/easter_text2c.htm

The dates of Easter are verified here. https://www.assa.org.au/edm#Method

This website lists the 1st Sundays of Advent. https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/first-sunday-advent

Ultimately, of course, the first tool has these dates, but it is more convenient to work from a list when entering fixed days such as Easter, used in the formulae of the spreadsheet program to generate other dates.
