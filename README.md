# Kalendarium

A repository for some materials related to the Catholic liturgy, namely a table of moveable feasts and the perpetual Roman calendar.

NB: when using the spreadsheets, please note that the original version is the Numbers version, as that is the program which I have freely available on macOS. The formula results are the same when exported to Excel's file format, but the way they are calculatd changes ("Column" becomes "Column Cell N" plus or minus the relevant days." This means that you do need to check the file extensions. Sorry about that!

Leap years in which Septuagesima or Ash Wednesday fall before March 1 are adjusted manually with respect to the relevant cells.

The tool for calculating the Dominical letter and the number of weeks after Pentecost is found here. https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/easter/easter_text2c.htm

The dates of Easter are verified here. https://www.assa.org.au/edm#Method

This website lists the 1st Sundays of Advent. https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/first-sunday-advent

Ultimately, of course, the first tool has these dates, but it is more convenient to work from a list when entering fixed days such as Easter, used in the formulae of the spreadsheet program to generate other dates.

Error-reporting and suggestions are both welcome.
